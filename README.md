# Javascript 30 Day 01

My successful attempt at the drumkit project. I made it a point to do everything I could without watching the video. Through just googling, I was able to get everything working my own way and the only thing I ended up altering to what was done by Wes was how I removed the playing class. Originally I was using a setTimeout that would remove it afterwords but as he says in the video, it isn't a great solution as it is easy for it to get messed up.
